# üì∫ Missing Trailer Downloader for Plex üé¨

I initially bought a [Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/) because I wanted to have Trailers for my movies and TV Shows.<br/>
For a minority of titles, Plex doesn't seem to have trailers however. Especially lesser known and foreign titles.

This script will fill those gaps.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Docker - Recommended)

**For beginners, this is the easiest way to get started:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/netplexflix/Missing-Trailer-Downloader-for-Plex.git
cd Missing-Trailer-Downloader-for-Plex

# 2. Run the automated setup
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 3. Edit your Plex configuration
nano config/config.yml

# 4. Restart the container
docker-compose restart
```

**That's it!** Your container will now automatically check for missing trailers every hour.

> [!TIP] > **New to Docker?** No problem! The setup script handles everything for you. Just make sure Docker is installed and running.

## üêã Installation via Docker (Recommended)

This script can be run in a Docker container, which will run continuously and check your Plex libraries automatically. The Docker setup includes all dependencies including the latest yt-dlp with Deno support.

### üöÄ Quick Start (Easiest Method)

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/netplexflix/Missing-Trailer-Downloader-for-Plex.git
   cd Missing-Trailer-Downloader-for-Plex
   ```

2. **Run the automated setup:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Configure your Plex settings:**

   ```bash
   nano config/config.yml
   ```

4. **Restart the container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart
   ```

That's it! Your container is now running and will check for missing trailers every hour.

### üìã Manual Docker Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. **Clone and prepare:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/netplexflix/Missing-Trailer-Downloader-for-Plex.git
   cd Missing-Trailer-Downloader-for-Plex
   mkdir -p config logs
   cp config.yml config/config.yml
   ```

2. **Start the container:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Edit configuration:**

   ```bash
   nano config/config.yml
   ```

4. **Restart after configuration:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart
   ```

### üîß Docker Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the container
docker-compose down

# Restart the container
docker-compose restart

# Access container shell for debugging
docker-compose exec missing-trailer-downloader /bin/bash

# Rebuild and start (after code changes)
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## üöÄ Usage

### üê≥ Docker Users (Recommended)

The Docker container runs automatically and checks for missing trailers every hour. No manual intervention needed!

**To check status:**

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Check if container is running
docker-compose ps
```

**To run manually (one-time scan):**

```bash
# Access container and run manually
docker-compose exec missing-trailer-downloader python MTDfP.py
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Installation Users

Open a Terminal in your script directory and launch the script with:

```sh
python MTDP.py
```

You'll be prompted to choose:

- **1**: Run Movie library.
- **2**: Run TV shows library.
- **3**: Scan both consecutively.

Alternatively, pre-set your preferred method in `config.yml` (`LAUNCH_METHOD` field) to bypass selection.

> [!TIP]
> Windows users can create a batch file to quickly launch the script.<br/>
