# üì∫ Missing Trailer Downloader for Plex üé¨

I initially bought a [Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/) because I wanted to have Trailers for my movies and TV Shows.<br/>
For a minority of titles, Plex doesn't seem to have trailers however. Especially lesser known and foreign titles.

This script will fill those gaps.

```sh

Alternatively, pre-set your preferred method in `config.yml` (`LAUNCH_METHOD` field) to bypass selection.
